# NASCOM_VSD_WORKSHOP
## DAY-1 (Inception of open source EDA , OpenLANE and sky130pdk):
  
 ## DAY-1-Theory
  Opensource EDA tools are tools which make ASIC design cheaper and collaborative. OpenLane is a package of opensource tools which are required at various stages of ASIC design. For example,Yosys is required for synthesys,OpenSTA is required for static-timing-analysis. Here SKY130 PDK has been used for this opensource SOC(System on Chip)development. In the current project, the verilog code of a riscv processor (namely picorv32a.v) is synthesised to produce sky-130 technology mapped std. cells.

## DAY-1-Lab  

## DAY-2 (Floorplanning , Placement and Library cells):

  After synthesis is done,the next stge is floorplanning. In this stage, the core area and die area are decied using proper utilisation factor.

                        Utilisation factor=(Area occupied by gate-level netlist/Total area of core)
